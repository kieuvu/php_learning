# 5. Loop

1. While Loop : 

```php
// Struct :
while (conditon) {
	// condition if true =>  continue
	// condition if false => break
}

// Eg :
$num1 = 0;
$result = 0;

while ($num1 <= 10) {
	echo ++$result. " ";
	$num1 ++;
}

// Result after the loop : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

1. Do While Loop : 

```php
// Struct :
do {
	// Command always executed at the first time
} while (condition) 
	// If true  => execute the "Do" command
	// If false => break loop

// Eg :
$time = 1;
do {
	echo "the loop was executed " .$time. " time <br/>";
	$time++;
} while ($time <= 5);

// Result after the loop :
/*
the loop was executed 1 time
the loop was executed 2 time
the loop was executed 3 time
the loop was executed 4 time
the loop was executed 5 time
*/
```

1. For Loop : 

```php
// Struct :
for ($initCounter ; condition ; $initCounterAction) {
	// If true  => continue
	// If false => break
}

// Eg :
for ($i=1 ; $i<=10; $i++) {
	echo $i." ";
}

// Result after the loop : i i i i i i i i i i  (10 times)

```
